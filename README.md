# MIRAGE - Reality Check: Industry Edition

A short, interactive, split-screen web experience designed for student engagement at industry–academia events.

## 🎯 Purpose

MIRAGE reveals the perceived alignment gap between how students think and how industry actually expects — through a calm, visual, and reflective experience. It's **not a quiz**, **not a placement tool**, and **not an assessment**.

## 🧠 Core Features

### Stream-Based Customization
Students select their engineering field:
- **Computer Science & IT** 💻
- **Mechanical Engineering** ⚙️
- **Electrical & Electronics** ⚡
- **Civil Engineering** 🏗️
- **Chemical Engineering** 🧪
- **Other Engineering** 🔧

Each stream has tailored scenarios relevant to that field.

### Split-Screen Experience
- **Left Panel**: Industry Expects (locked & hidden during questions)
- **Right Panel**: Student chooses (interactive responses)
- **Final Reveal**: Visual comparison showing alignment percentage

### Results & Insights
- Alignment score (not pass/fail)
- Personalized insights identifying:
  - 1 strength area
  - 1 growth opportunity
  - 1 suggested focus area

## 🚀 Getting Started
